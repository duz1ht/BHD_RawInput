; RawInput Launcher configuration
; The launcher reads this file from the same folder as BHD_RawInput_Launcher.exe.

; GameExe can be just a filename (resolved relative to the launcher folder)
; or a full path. If AllowCommandLineArgs=1, you may include arguments.
GameExe=dfbhd.exe

; When enabled, the launcher allows command-line arguments in GameExe.
; Example:
; GameExe=E:\Novalogic\DFBHD\BHD_VANILA_SEM_NADA_ORIGINAL\dfbhd.exe /w
AllowCommandLineArgs=0
